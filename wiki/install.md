## Full version

**Step 1)** Delete your old AddOn files (this will NOT touch your settings, because they are stored in the WTF folder)  
**Note:** Never overwrite/replace AddOn files. Always delete the old folders first.  
**Step 2)** Download your AddOn from the website  
**Step 3)** Rightclick the .zip file and select "**Extract All...**" (Windows)  
**Step 4)** Open the extracted folder and check the capitalization  
**Example:** For ElvUI "**ElvUI**" & "**ElvUI_OptionsUI**" (cAsE mAtTeRs) (without the quotes)  
**Step 5)** Move them to the correct WoW folder: Either **_retail_** or **_classic_** -> **Interface** -> **AddOns**  

**Many people have multiple World of Warcraft folders on their system and don't know about it.**  
**Here is a quick screenshot guide how to check for the correct folder path.**  

Open your **Battle.net app** and select World of Warcraft - then click on the "**Options**" dropdown (Cogwheel icon)
